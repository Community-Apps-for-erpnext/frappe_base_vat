### Introduction

This is my fisrt application in frappe framework. I don't give ANY WARRANTY, but it works!!!.

I made this because it will be necessary in my country to operate, this and other things i intent to do for this framework.

I also made this to learn the frappe framework and don't double check neither the code and neither i was concerned with code presentation. So maybe the code is not too well structured.
Maybe another time with more time!!!

This app check if the VAT / NIF is correct. This app use module vatnumber to check the VAT for the particular country and optionaly will be fully validated against EU's VIES service.
